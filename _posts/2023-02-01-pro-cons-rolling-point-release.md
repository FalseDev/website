In the world of Linux distributions, there are **Point releases** (fixed releases) and **Rolling releases** (continuous releass). Each type of release has its own advantages and disadvantages.

## Point releases

Point releases are well known for their stability. When a point release is made, it is a stable version that has been tested thoroughly before being released. This ensures that the user will experience fewer bugs and issues, making the overall experience more stable. Those releases also receive security updates, which is crucial in today's world of online threats.

Furthermore, point releases are easier to support since they are a fixed version, making it easier for the community to troubleshoot and resolve any issues that arise in the future. This is a huge advantage for those who need a stable and reliable operating system, such as businesses or professionals.

However, point releases have their own disadvantages. One major is that they tend to receive updates later than other distributions. This is because point releases are usually more focused on stability, and updates are thoroughly tested before being released. As a result, users of point releases often have to wait longer for new software or features.

Some examples of point releases are Vanilla OS, [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) and [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).

## Rolling releases

Rolling releases provide a more up-to-date experience. With a rolling release, users can receive updates as soon as they are available, which means that users always have access to the latest software and features. This is a huge advantage for those who want to use the latest technology or those who like to be on the cutting edge. Rolling releases also provide the latest security updates.

However, rolling releases have their own disadvantages. The most significant disadvantage is that they can be less stable. Since rolling releases receive updates continuously, there is a risk that bugs or issues may arise. This is because the user is receiving updates as soon as they are available, with a reduced testing window. As a result, users of rolling releases may experience more bugs and issues compared to users of point releases.

Some examples of rolling releases are [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed).

## Modern package formats

To overcome the disadvantages of point releases and rolling releases, several new technologies have been developed, such as [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/), [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/), and [AppImage](https://appimage.org/). 

Flatpak and Snap are modern package formats that provide a sandbox for each application, ensuring they runs independently without interfering with other applications or the system. This helps to maintain stability and security. Furthermore, all these modern package formats come with all the necessary dependencies, making it portable and easy to install on any Linux distribution.

[Apx](https://vanillaos.org/2023/01/28/apx-the-unconventional-pkg-manager.html) is another solution that has been developed by Vanilla OS and [Distrobox](https://distrobox.privatedns.org/). It allows users to install software from any other Linux distributions, using the power of [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/). This means that users can receive updates without any risk of destabilizing the system.
